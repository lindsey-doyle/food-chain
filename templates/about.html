    <p style="color:white; font-size: small;">Our goal is to develop a user-customizable, content-based restaurant recommender system so that you can decide for yourself which parts of your dining experience matter most. </p>

      Generating these personalized recommendations is a multi-stage process. We first take information provided by the user in order to establish a location of reference. This data is obtained through the utlization of Yelp's API. We next structure this information in a manner which allows us to easily specify how we search for similarity. From the organized data, we then search for restuarants which are the most similar based on the user specified inputs designated earlier. We then display our search results to the user so that the user can inspect their new restaurant options.
